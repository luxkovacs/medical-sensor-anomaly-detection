    "# Initial Sleep-EDF data exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the [Sleep-EDF Database Expanded](https://physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/) from PhysioNet, which contains 197 whole-night polysomnographic sleep recordings. The dataset includes data from two studies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sleep Cassette (SC)** - 153 recordings from 78 healthy subjects (aged 25-101) without sleep-related disorders\n",
    "2. **Sleep Telemetry (ST)** - 44 recordings from subjects with mild difficulty falling asleep\n",
    "\n",
    "Each recording contains physiological signals recorded during sleep, along with expert annotations of sleep stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is organized in two main folders:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sleep-cassette/**: contains recordings from the Sleep Cassette study\n",
    "- **sleep-telemetry/**: contains recordings from the Sleep Telemetry study\n",
    "\n",
    "For each subject, there are two primary files:\n",
    "- **[ID]-PSG.edf**: the polysomnography recording containing all physiological signals\n",
    "- **[ID]-Hypnogram.edf**: the annotations of sleep stages by human experts\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional metadata is available in:\n",
    "- **SC-subjects.xls**: information about subjects in the Sleep Cassette study\n",
    "- **ST-subjects.xls**: information about subjects in the Sleep Telemetry study\n",
    "\n",
    "## Signal Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "### PSG Files\n",
    "Each PSG file contains multiple channels:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Channel | Description | Sampling Rate |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|---------------|\n",
    "| EEG Fpz-Cz | Electroencephalogram (frontal-central) | 100 Hz |\n",
    "| EEG Pz-Oz | Electroencephalogram (parietal-occipital) | 100 Hz |\n",
    "| EOG horizontal | Electrooculogram (eye movements) | 100 Hz |\n",
    "| EMG submental | Electromyogram (chin muscle activity) | 100 Hz |\n",
    "| Event marker | Annotations of events | Variable |\n",
    "| Body temperature | Temperature measurements (not in all recordings) | 1 Hz |\n",
    "| Respiration | Respiratory signal (not in all recordings) | 1 Hz |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypnogram Files\n",
    "Sleep stages are coded according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&K) manual:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Code | Sleep Stage | Description |\n",
    "|------|-------------|-------------|\n",
    "| 0 | W | Wake |\n",
    "| 1 | 1 | Non-REM stage 1 |\n",
    "| 2 | 2 | Non-REM stage 2 |\n",
    "| 3 | 3 | Non-REM stage 3 |\n",
    "| 4 | 4 | Non-REM stage 4 |\n",
    "| 5 | R | REM sleep |\n",
    "| 6 | M | Movement time |\n",
    "| 9 | ? | Unknown |\n",
    "\n",
    "Sleep stages 3 & 4 are often combined in modern scoring as N3 (slow-wave sleep).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Information\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File Format**: European Data Format (EDF)\n",
    "- **Recording Duration**: typically ~20 hours, including pre-sleep and post-sleep periods\n",
    "- **Annotation Intervals**: sleep stages are annotated in 30-second epochs\n",
    "- **Main Paper**: [The Sleep-EDF Database Expanded](https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2018.2872652)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll use the MNE-Python library to load and analyze these EDF files."
