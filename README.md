# Medical Sensor Anomaly Detection

This project implements an anomaly detection system for medical sensor data, focusing on both statistical and machine learning approaches. The project will start with the Sleep-EDF Database Expanded, with more to come.

## Repository Structure

- data/: Contains raw and processed datasets
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and algorithm development
- src/: Source code for the project
  - data/: Data loading and preprocessing
  - detection/: Anomaly detection algorithms
  - visualization/: Data visualization utilities
  - database/: Database operations
  - security/: Security features
- 	tests/: Unit tests
- dashboard/: Streamlit dashboard application
- docs/: Project documentation

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv
3. Activate the environment:
   - Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   - Unix/Mac: source venv/bin/activate
4. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Details coming soon as the project develops.
